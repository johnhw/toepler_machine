* sharp edges in inductor plates?
* dodgy fit between hex and sphere in handle
* external connection for leyden jars (need to go to neutraliser bar or to each other)
* guides along neutraliser bar path (at correct angles)
* allow brushes to extend further across the disk

* factor out axle generation and both round axle and tight axle female holes (add keying option)
* factor out rod/conductor generation
* measure brush ends from centre of disk, not spark support axis
* separate connector balls
* screw threads for spark balls
* optional torus fittings for spherical joints
* feet / feet holes
* splittable base board
* skeleton supports
* vertically splittable spark supports

* annotations and key axes: consider http://www.cannymachines.com/entries/9/openscad_dimensioned_drawings
